MASV File Format
----------------
A MASV file is a tab-seperated file that is used to store data and metadata.
In a version 1 file, the data consists of multiple named features, all of the same type and
a number of replicates. The metadata consists of named features associated with the
samples, such as covariates and experimental conditions and named meta-features associated
with the features. Each feature has a type.
The data and metadata can have missing values which are given as an empty cell.
The file can be thought of as a sequence of rows, each of which contains a number of cells,
seperated by tabs

Types in this file format consist of the following:
* float: A floating point type
* str: A string type
* int: An integer type
* factor: A factor type
* date: A data, time or date-time in ISO 8601 format

The first row consists of the following:
* The first cell is the string "MASV:1", where "1" stands for the version of the standard
* Next comes a blank cell
* Next come the names of all the features in the data, one for each cell
* Next come the names of all the covariates, one for each cell

The second row consists of the following:
* The first cell is blank
* The next cell contains the type of the data
* Next come blank cells, one for each for each data feature
* Next come type cells, one for each covariate

From then on, each row consists of:
* The first cell is the name of a sample
* Next comes a blank cell
* Next come data value cells, one for each feature
* Next come covariate value cells, one for each covariate

After this, each row consists of:
* The first cell is the name of a meta-feature
* Next comes a type cell of that meta-feature,
* Next come meta-feature values cells, one for each feature
