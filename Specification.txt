MASV File Format
----------------
A MASV file is a tab-seperated file that is used to store data and metadata.
In a version 1 file, the data consists of multiple named features, grouped by type and
a number of replicates. The metadata consists of named features associated with the
samples, such as covariates and experimental conditions and named meta-features associated
with the features. Each feature has a type.
The data and metadata can have missing values which are given as an empty cell.
The file can be thought of as a sequence of rows, each of which contains a number of cells,
seperated by tabs

Types in this file format consist of the following:
* float: A floating point type
* str: A string type
* int: An integer type
* factor: A factor type
* date: A data, time or date-time in ISO 8601 format

The first row consists of the following:
* The first cell is the string "MASV:1", where "1" stands for the version of the standard
* For each group of features there is a blank cell, then a cell with the name of each feature
* After all features in all groups the names of covariates are also specifiecied, one in each cell

The second row consists of the following:
* The first cell is blank
* For each group of features there is cell specificying the data type, followed by a blank cell for each feature
* Next come type cells, one for each covariate

The third row consists of the following:
* The first cell is blank
* For each group of features there is cell specifying the name of the feature group then a blank cell for each feature

From then on, each row consists of:
* The first cell is the name of a sample
* Next comes a blank cell
* Next come data value cells, one for each feature
* Next come covariate value cells, one for each covariate

After this, each row consists of:
* The first cell is the name of a meta-feature
* Next comes a type cell of that meta-feature,
* Next come meta-feature values cells, one for each feature
